# Method 2 - Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s = 'azcbobobegghakl'

s = 'azcbobobegghakl'
slength = len(s)
numBob = 0

for k in range(0,slength):
    if s[k] == 'b' and s[k+1] == 'o' and s[k+2] == 'b':
        numBob += 1
print(numBob)

# comment: cleaner but I am not comfortable with the k+2. potential for error?
